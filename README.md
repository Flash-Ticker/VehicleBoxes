## Description

**SwimmingDrops** brings supply drops to life in water environments. This plugin ensures that supply drops behave realistically when they land in water, providing a more immersive and balanced game experience.

## Features:
- Allows supply drops to float gently on water surfaces
- Maintains the original landing behavior of supply drops
- Automatically releases the parachutes when the drops float to the water surface
- Efficient performance with minimal impact on server resources
- Does not affect the trajectory or drop position of supply drops
- Maintains the original orientation of the supply drop when it lands in the water
- Can fall over in the water and still swim realistically
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing supply drop system in Rust
